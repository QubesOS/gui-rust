//! # Rust bindings to, and specification of, the Qubes OS GUI Protocol (QOGP).
//!
//! ## Transport and Terminology
//!
//! The Qubes OS GUI protocol is spoken over a vchan between two virtual
//! machines (VMs).  The VM providing GUI services is the client of this vchan,
//! while the VM that wishes to display its GUI is the server.  The component
//! that provides GUI services to other VMs is known as the *GUI daemon*, and
//! the component that the GUI daemon connects to is known as the *GUI agent*.
//!
//! ## Message format
//!
//! Each message is a C struct that is cast to a byte slice and sent
//! directly over the vchan, without any marshalling or unmarshalling steps.
//! This is safe because no GUI message has any padding bytes.  Similarly, the
//! receiver casts a C struct to a mutable byte slice and reads the bytes
//! directly into the struct.  This is safe because all possible bit patterns
//! are valid for every GUI message.  All messages are in native byte order,
//! which is little-endian for the only platform (amd64) supported by Qubes OS.
//!
//! This is very natural to implement in C, but is much less natural to
//! implement in Rust, as casting a struct reference to a byte slice is
//! `unsafe`.  To ensure that this does not cause security vulnerabilities,
//! this library uses the `qubes-castable` crate.  That crate provides a
//! `castable!` macro to define structs that can be safely casted to a byte
//! slice.  `castable!` guarantees that every struct it defines can be safely
//! cast to a byte slice and back; if it cannot, a compile-time error results.
//! Functions provided by the `qubes-castable` crate are used to perform the
//! conversions.  To ensure that they cannot be called on inappropriate types
//! (such as `bool`), they require the unsafe `Castable` trait to be implemented.
//! The `castable!` macro implements this trait for every type it defines, and
//! the `qubes-castable` crate implements it for all fixed-width primitive
//! integer types, `()`, and arrays of `Castable` objects (regardless of length).
//!
//! Both clients and servers MUST send each message atomically.  Specifically,
//! the server MAY use blocking I/O over the vchan.  The client MUST NOT block
//! on the server, to avoid deadlocks.  Therefore, the client should buffer its
//! messages and flush them at every opportunity.  This requirement is a
//! consequence of how difficult asynchronous I/O is in C, and of the desire to
//! keep the code as simple as possible.  Implementations in other languages, or
//! which uses proper asynchronous I/O libraries, SHOULD NOT have this
//! limitation.
//!
//! ## Window IDs
//!
//! The Qubes OS GUI protocol refers to each surface by a 32-bit unsigned window
//! ID.  Zero is reserved and means “no window”.  For instance, using zero for a
//! window’s parent means that the window does not have a parent.  Otherwise,
//! agents are free to choose any window ID they wish.  In particular, while X11
//! limits IDs to a maximum of 2²⁹ - 1, the Qubes OS GUI protocol imposes no
//! such restriction.
//!
//! It is a protocol error for an agent to send a message to a window that does
//! not exist, including a window which it has deleted.  Because of unavoidable
//! race conditions, agents may recieve events for windows they have already
//! destroyed.  Such messages MUST be ignored.
//!
//! ## Unrecognized messages
//!
//! GUI daemons MUST treat messages with an unknown type as a protocol error.
//! GUI agents MAY log the headers of such messages and MUST otherwise ignore
//! them.  The bodies of such messages MUST NOT be logged as they may contain
//! sensitive data.
//!
//! ## Shared memory
//!
//! The Qubes GUI protocol uses inter-qube shared memory for all images.  This
//! shared memory is not sanitized in any way whatsoever, and may be modified
//! by the other side at any time without synchronization.  Therefore, all
//! access to the shared memory is `unsafe`.  Or rather, it *would* be unsafe,
//! were it not that no such access is required at all!  This avoids requiring
//! any form of signal handling, which is both `unsafe` and ugly.
//!
//! ## Differences from the reference implementation
//!
//! The reference implementation of the GUI protocol considers the GUI daemon
//! (the server) to be trusted, while the GUI agent is not trusted.  As such,
//! the GUI agent blindly trusts the GUI daemon, while the GUI daemon must
//! carefully validate all data from the GUI agent.
//!
//! This Rust implementation takes a different view: *Both* the client and server
//! consider the other to be untrusted, and all messages are strictly validated.
//! This is necessary to meet Rust safety requirements, and also makes bugs in
//! the server easier to detect.
//!
//! Additionally, the Rust protocol definition is far, *far* better documented,
//! and explicitly lists each reference to the X11 protocol specification.  A
//! future release will not depend on the X11 protocol specification at all,
//! even for documentation.
